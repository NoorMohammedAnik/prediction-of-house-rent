## 🏠 Simple House Price Predictor using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a **basic linear regression** model to predict house prices based on area (in square feet) using **Python**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**.

---

### 📁 **Project Files**

* **`predict_price.py`** — Main Python script containing the training and prediction code.
* **`data.csv`** *(optional)* — You can use your own CSV file instead of the sample data.

---

### ✅ **How It Works**

1. **Load Data:**

   * By default, the script uses a small sample dataset:

     | Area (sqft) | Price (Tk) |
     | ----------- | ---------- |
     | 1000        | 20,000     |
     | 1500        | 30,000     |
     | 2000        | 40,000     |
     | 2500        | 50,000     |
     | 3000        | 60,000     |
   * Alternatively, you can load your own dataset by replacing the sample data with:

     ```python
     df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
     ```

     *(Make sure `data.csv` is in the same folder)*

2. **Train Model:**

   * The script uses `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn` to train a model on `Area` vs `Price`.

3. **Predict Price:**

   * The user inputs the area in square feet.
   * The script predicts the expected house price and displays it nicely formatted.

### 🚀 **How To Run**

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-predictor.git
   cd house-price-predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python predict_price.py
   ```

4. **Follow the prompt:**

   ```
   Enter the area of the house in square feet:
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   Enter the area of the house in square feet: 
   2200
   Predicted price: Tk 44,000.00

   Predicted price: Tk 44,000
   ```
